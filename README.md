<p align="center"><b>Develop robust cryptographic hash functions by analyzing the randomness in natural phenomena.</b></p>

##

### About
This repository explores the utilization of randomness derived from naturally occurring phenomena to generate entropic values, which in turn are employed for producing truly random hashes. By harnessing the inherent unpredictability found in observable natural processes, the project aims to advance the development of cryptographic hash functions with enhanced security and reliability.

### Dynamic Formations in Natural Phenomena
 - Oil-Water Interaction
   - Utilizes the entropic properties observed in the interaction between oil and water, comparable to the dynamic patterns seen in lava lamps. 
 - Cloud Formation
   - Uses observable differences in cloud formations to generate entropic values.
 - Flame Movement Dynamics
   - Determines entropic values by analyzing the dynamic and distinctive motion of flames, considering their potential interactions with external forces.

### Consideration of advantages and drawbacks
Compression of images can impact the randomness of the images. It reduces storage and computational costs but can potentially decrease the randomness of the hashes generated. The choice of compression algorithm should be carefully considered to minimize the impact on randomness while maintaining acceptable efficiency. Storing images securely is essential to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation, which could compromise the integrity of the hash generation process. Encryption, access control, and regular backups are essential security measures. However, these measures can also introduce performance overhead and potential vulnerabilities.

### Entropy Assessment Framework
The entropy assessment framework provides a methodology and tools for quantifying the randomness of observable natural processes. It utilizes statistical techniques to analyze the distribution of values within a given data set and estimate its entropy, a measure of unpredictability.

#### Methodology
**The framework follows a three-step process:**
  1. Data Collection: The natural process under observation is captured and converted into a digital format, such as an image or a time series.
  2. Histogram Generation: A histogram is constructed to represent the frequency distribution of values within the data set.
  3. Entropy Calculation: The entropy of the data set is calculated using the histogram and the formula for Shannon entropy:
 
     $$H = -\sum_{x \in X} p(x) \log_2 p(x)$$
     where p(x) is the probability of occurrence of each value x in the data set.
#### Script Usage
The CalculateEntropy script provided in the repository demonstrates the use of the framework. It captures an image using a Python script and then calculates the entropy of the captured image.

#### Code Explanation
  1. Data Collection (Python): The capture_image.py script is executed to capture an image.
  2. Entropy Calculation (Java):
     - The calculateEntropy method reads the captured image from the specified file path.
     - A histogram is generated to count the frequency of each pixel intensity value in the image.
     - The entropy is calculated using the histogram and the Shannon entropy formula.
          ```
              public static double calculateEntropy(int[] histogram) {
              double entropy = 0;
              int total = 0;
              for (int value : histogram) {
                  total += value;
              }
              for (int value : histogram) {
                  if (value > 0) {
                      double probability = (double) value / total;
                      entropy -= probability * (Math.log(probability) / Math.log(2));
                  }
              }
              return entropy;
          }
          ```
          **(where histogram is an array containing the frequency of occurrence of each value in the data set.)**
     
#### Output
The output of the script is the calculated entropy value, which represents the level of randomness in the captured image. A higher entropy value indicates greater randomness.

#### Limitations
The accuracy of the entropy assessment depends on the quality and representativeness of the data collected. The framework assumes that the data set is sufficiently large and captures the underlying dynamics of the natural process.

#### Applications
The entropy assessment framework can be used in various applications, including:
  - Evaluating the randomness of naturally occurring phenomena
  - Developing random number generators based on natural processes
  - Assessing the security of cryptographic algorithms that rely on random inputs
